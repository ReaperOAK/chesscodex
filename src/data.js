  { quote: "If you‚Äôre serious about improving your chess skills, I wholeheartedly recommend Arpan Sir and Joydeep Sir [Aspire Chess Academy]. None came close to what I‚Äôve gained under Arpan Sir and Joydeep Sir. Before them, I struggled with positional understanding, planning, and other fundamentals. Here, I‚Äôm learning these every day along with so much more. What sets them apart is their friendly and approachable teaching style, which bridges the usual gap between a coach and a student, which makes learning enjoyable and breaks the usual coach-student barrier. They also provide practice sessions that have helped me a lot. I‚Äôm truly grateful for their guidance.", name: "Dhruv Kar", role: "Chess Enthusiast", avatar: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPrloGLYTtuRAB7qTnRTnQ35fAmk1NEaxWqTQhbUML5qX5Ovg=w108-h108-p-rp-mo-br100" },
